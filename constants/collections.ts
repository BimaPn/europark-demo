    description: `Café Terrace at Night is an 1888 oil painting by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. It is also known as The Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum, and, when first exhibited in 1891, was entitled Coffeehouse, in the evening (Café, le soir).

Van Gogh painted Café Terrace at Night in Arles, France, in mid-September 1888. The painting is not signed, but described and mentioned by the artist in three letters.

Visitors to the site can stand at the north eastern corner of the Place du Forum, where the artist set up his easel. The site was refurbished in 1990 and 1991 to replicate van Gogh's painting. He looked south towards the artificially lit terrace of the popular coffee house, as well as into the enforced darkness of the rue du Palais which led up to a building structure (to the left, not pictured) and, beyond this structure, the tower of a former church which is now Musée Lapidaire.

Towards the right, Van Gogh indicated a lighted shop and some branches of the trees surrounding the place, but he omitted the remainders of the Roman monuments just beside this little shop.

The painting is currently at the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, Netherlands. `

    description: `Starry Night (September 1888, French: La Nuit étoilée), commonly known as Starry Night Over the Rhône, is one of Vincent van Gogh's paintings of Arles at night. It was painted on the bank of the Rhône that was only a one or two-minute walk from the Yellow House on the Place Lamartine, which van Gogh was renting at the time. The night sky and the effects of light at night provided the subject for some of van Gogh's more famous paintings, including Café Terrace at Night (painted earlier the same month) and the June, 1889, canvas from Saint-Remy, The Starry Night.

A sketch of the painting is included in a letter van Gogh sent to his friend Eugène Boch on 2 October 1888.

Starry Night, which is now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, was first exhibited in 1889 at Paris' annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants. It was shown together with van Gogh's Irises, which was added by Vincent's brother, Theo, although Vincent had proposed including one of his paintings from the public gardens in Arles.`

    description: `Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette (Dutch: Kop van een skelet met brandende sigaret) is an early work by Vincent van Gogh. The small and undated oil-on-canvas painting featuring a skeleton and cigarette is part of the permanent collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. It was most likely painted in the winter of 1885–86 as a satirical comment on conservative academic practices. Before it was common to use live humans as models, the academic routine included the study of skeletons to develop an understanding of human anatomy. Van Gogh was in Antwerp, Belgium at that time attending classes at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, which he later said were boring and taught him nothing.

Van Gogh included skeletons in another work from his Antwerp period, a sketch of a "Hanging skeleton and cat".[3] In 1887–88, van Gogh painted two more paintings with skulls, the only other works of his (besides a drawing from the same period) to use skulls as a motif.

The work measures 32 by 24.5 centimetres (12.6 in × 9.6 in). It is considered a vanitas or memento mori, at a time when van Gogh himself was in poor health. It may be influenced by works of Hercules Segers, a 17th-century Dutch artist, or of Félicien Rops, a Belgian contemporary of van Gogh. Although often interpreted as a criticism of smoking, Van Gogh was a keen smoker himself, and continued to smoke until his death in 1890.

The painting was held by Van Gogh's brother Theo Van Gogh at the time of his death in 1891. It was inherited by his widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger until her death in 1925, and then by their son Vincent Willem van Gogh until 1962, when it was acquired by the Van Gogh Foundation. It was on loan to the Stedelijk Museum from 1962 to 1973, and has been on permanent loan to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam since 1973.`

    description: `In early 1888, Van Gogh moved to Arles in the south of France, where he hoped to establish an art colony. Believing that painting could be reinvented through the genre of portraiture, he encouraged his fellow artists to paint themselves, and then to exchange the canvases. After receiving self-portraits from Emile Bernard and Gauguin, who were working together in Brittany at the time, Van Gogh inscribed this painting “To my friend Paul Gauguin,” and sent it to him. He described the process of creating his arresting likeness in several letters to his brother Theo, an art dealer in Paris, explaining how he manipulated his features in response to Japanese prints, changed the contours of his jacket for coloristic effect, and painted the background “pale veronese green” without any shadows. Shortly after he sent the work to Gauguin, however, their friendship deteriorated, and Gauguin sold it for three hundred francs.`

    description: `The artwork “Self-Portrait with Felt Hat” is a notable creation by the esteemed artist Vincent Van Gogh, dated circa 1887. This oil on canvas masterpiece is a quintessential example of the Post-Impressionism movement. Measuring 44 x 37.5 cm, the self-portrait can be appreciated at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The artwork was brought to life in Paris, France, where Van Gogh resided and found new inspiration during that period.

The self-portrait displays the artist with direct gaze, confronting the viewer. Van Gogh has rendered his visage with a rich tapestry of vibrant brushstrokes, illuminating his features with bold and contrasting colors. A felt hat adorns his head, its texture meticulously captured through the artist’s distinctive application of paint. The background swirls in a hypnotic pattern of blues and greens, suggesting a dynamic and restless atmosphere. This careful orchestration of color and gesture highlights the emotional intensity and psychological depth that Van Gogh infused into his work, offering a window into the artist’s soul.

    description: `The Return of the Prodigal Son (Dutch: De terugkeer van de verloren zoon) is an oil painting by Rembrandt, part of the collection of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. It is among the Dutch master's final works, likely completed within two years of his death in 1669. Depicting the moment of the prodigal son's return to his father in the Biblical parable, it is a renowned work described by art historian Kenneth Clark as "a picture which those who have seen the original in St. Petersburg may be forgiven for claiming as the greatest picture ever painted".

In the painting, the son has returned home in a wretched state from travels in which he has wasted his inheritance and fallen into poverty and despair. He kneels before his father in repentance, wishing for forgiveness and the position of a servant in his father's household, having realized that even his father's servants had a better station in life than he. His father receives him with a tender gesture and welcomes him as his own son. His hands seem to suggest mothering and fathering at once; the left appears larger and more masculine, set on the son's shoulder, while the right is softer and more receptive in gesture. Standing at the right is the prodigal son's older brother, who crosses his hands in judgmen`

    description: `Self Portrait (or The Large Self-Portrait) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch artist Rembrandt. Painted in 1652, it is one of more than 40 painted self-portraits by Rembrandt, and was the first he had painted since 1645. In composition it is different from his previous self-portraits, depicting the painter in a direct frontal pose, hands on his hips, and with an air of self-confidence. It was painted the year that his financial difficulties began, and breaks with the sumptuous finery he had worn in previous self-portraits.[1] Art historian Christopher White has called it "one of the most magisterial and sombre of these (late) pictures". It is in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.
Rembrandt. Full-Length Self Portrait, c. 1650. Pen and brown ink on brownish paper. The only full-length self-portrait Rembrandt drew on paper, this may have been drawn in preparation for the painted Self Portrait.

The freely painted clothing includes a brown robe that was most likely casual working attire, secured with a sash, over a black doublet with an upturned collar. A drawing from c. 1650 shows Rembrandt in much the same pose and attire, and features an inscription, though not by the artist's hand, stating that these were the artist's studio clothes. In the drawing Rembrandt is seen wearing a top hat, while in the painting he wears a black beret derivative of artists' portraits of the 16th century.

Following a period of seven years when he painted no self-portraits, focusing instead on landscapes and intimate domestic subjects, the Vienna Self Portrait inaugurated a prolific stretch in which Rembrandt painted an average of one self-portrait a year until his death in 1669. Contrary to the popular understanding that these paintings primarily represented a deeper personal interest in self-depiction, Ernst van de Wetering has proposed that they were painted specifically for connoisseurs who collected self-portraits by prominent artists.

As in other late portraits and self-portraits by Rembrandt, a painted underlayer shows through in areas of shadow, here particularly in the eye sockets and beneath the moustache. Microscopic analysis has revealed that this is not the painted ground layer, which is a similar gray color, but a separate underlayer of paint.[6] This local imprimatura, used in preparation for specific areas of the painting, was also practiced by Vermeer, and its purpose is not fully understood.`

    description: `Woman Bathing or A Woman Bathing in a Stream is a c.1654 painting by Rembrandt, now in the National Gallery, London, which acquired it in 1831. It was probably modelled on Rembrandt's partner Hendrickje Stoffels, and represents a woman in a vulnerable state, stepping into her bath. Some scholars believe the painting is meant to represent the nymph Callisto, bathing apart from Diana's entourage.

The painting is broadly executed. Art historian Gary Schwartz refers to it as an "oil sketch enlarged to the dimensions of a full-scale painting" and calls it "one of the freshest and most original of Rembrandt's works in oil."`

    description: `The painting "The Holy Family with Angels" by the artist Rembrandt is a masterpiece that has captured the attention of art lovers for centuries. This painting, measuring 117 x 91 cm, presents the Holy Family surrounded by angels, who watch them with adoration and devotion.

Rembrandt's artistic style is characterized by his technique of light and shadow, which creates a dramatic and emotional atmosphere in his works. In "The Holy Family with Angels", the artist uses this technique to highlight the figure of the Virgin Mary and her son Jesus, who are seated in the center of the painting. The light that illuminates their faces and bodies makes them stand out against the dark background, creating an effect of depth and three-dimensionality.

The composition of the painting is interesting, as Rembrandt has placed the angels in different positions around the Holy Family. Some are sitting on the ground, while others are floating in the air. This arrangement creates a sense of movement and dynamism in the work, which makes it even more interesting to observe.

Regarding color, Rembrandt has used warm and dark tones to create an intimate and welcoming atmosphere. The clothes of the Virgin Mary and Jesus are painted in earthy tones, while the angels have brighter, more colorful garments. These color contrasts help bring out the main figures in the painting.

The history of the painting is interesting as it is believed to have been created in 1640, during the period when Rembrandt was experimenting with his artistic style. The work was commissioned by an unknown client and has been held in private collections for centuries. In 2017, the painting was acquired by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, where it can be seen today.

In conclusion, Rembrandt's "The Holy Family with Angels" is a fascinating work of art that combines masterful technique, interesting composition, careful use of color, and an intriguing story. This painting is a sample of the talent and creativity of one of the most important artists in the history of art.`

    description: `With great power and poignancy, Rembrandt has depicted a young man literally weighed down with heavy armour and weapons, and appearing to have profound thoughts of battles ahead. Significantly, this soldier's armour, circular shield and lance are all of a style essentially obsolete by the time the painting was made. This suggests that he is to be understood as a figure from the past. His helmet, evoking antiquity, is an invention by the artist, mixing the rear neck-guard of a contemporary cavalry helmet with a brow plate and crest in a style then considered to be characteristically classical. Who the man in the painting is has been a matter of continuing debate. Classical heroes, such as Achilles, or gods, such as Mars and Apollo, have been proposed, while warrior goddesses such as Bellona and Pallas Athene (the Roman Minerva) have also been suggested by virtue of the subject's youthful features and prominent pearl earring.`

    description: `The work measures 36 by 48.125 inches (91.44 cm × 122.24 cm) and is in oils. Fisherman at Sea depicts a moonlit view of fishermen on rough seas near the Isle of Wight, and is a work of marine art. It juxtaposes the fragility of human life, represented by the small boat with its flickering lamp, and the sublime power of nature, represented by the dark clouded sky, the wide sea, and the threatening rocks in the background. The cold light of the Moon at night contrasts with the warmer glow of the fishermen's lantern. The chalk formations on the left of the work were traditionally thought to be the Needles on the western tip of the island; however, this has been contested, with some scholars suggesting that the chalk cliffs are instead the ones at the nearby Freshwater Bay.

The work shows strong influence from the work of artists such as Claude Joseph Vernet, Philip James de Loutherbourg, and the intimate nocturnal scenes of Joseph Wright of Derby, especially in its handling of light and shadow.`

    description: `In the foreground, two dead horses and a dead man are piled together, casualties of the earlier plague of pestilence in livestock. To the right, Moses stands with his arms outstretched, cursing the Egyptians with a plague of hail and fire, far away from the engulfed city. In the background, tumultuous clouds swirl above the Egyptian city, which is denoted by the gleaming, white pyramid in the centre of the canvas. Thin, horizontal lines fall from the clouds, showing streaks of hail falling from the sky. The painting is dominated with dark, neutral tones, creating the feeling of gloom.

Although the painting would be categorised as a history painting for its display of a biblical scene, the painting comes across as a landscape painting, clearly demonstrating Turner's training in landscapes. The sky and the scenery take precedence over the figure of Moses and his actions, instead turning him into part of the landscape. The painting shows the force of nature as a more important factor than the force of man, which is minuscule. `

    description: `The artwork titled “Peace – Burial at Sea” is an oil on canvas created by the illustrious artist Joseph Mallord William Turner in the year 1842. Measuring 87 by 86.5 cm, this piece is housed at the Tate Gallery in London. It exemplifies Turner’s masterful use of light and composition to evoke emotion and narrative.

“Peace – Burial at Sea” depicts a somber maritime scene that is rich in metaphor and melancholy. The painting features a ship in the central foreground, its sails dark and looming, partly shrouded in shadow and emitting a trail of black smoke that billows into the air. This smoke drifts across the composition, becoming entwined with the clouds and the muted tones of the sky, suggesting an interplay between the elements of air and water. The sea itself is rendered in subdued tones, with patches of light reflecting upon the water’s surface, infusing the scene with a sense of calm despite the underlying somber theme.

Other ships can be discerned in the distance, their forms less distinct and enveloped in a fine mist, contributing to the atmospheric quality of the work. The overall mood of the painting is contemplative, evoking a sense of the sublime through the vast expanse of sky and water. Turner’s manipulation of light and color creates a visual metaphor for life and death, with the ship serving as a vessel on its final journey, accompanied by the vast, timeless elements of nature. This piece is emblematic of Turner’s profound ability to convey profound themes through his landscapes and seascapes.`

    description: `‘Dolbadarn Castle’ by J. M. W. Turner is an important composition because it represents a long period of study of the Welsh landscape. Turner became fascinated with North Wales and particularly studied the history of the slaughter of the bards by Edward I and the tragic infighting resulting in the long captivity of Owain Goch (Owain the Red), by his own brother. Both subjects inspired some of his most poignant paintings. This small oil painting shows the dramatic moment in 1255 when Owain was lead to the tower of Dolbadarn, which became his prison for over 20 years. Turner emphasises the steep cliffs up to the castle, greatly exaggerating their scale and avoiding any reference to Snowdon mountain or the valley and lakes adjacent. The paint is a wonderful combination of loose, thin washes together with deep swathes of dark colour symbolising the pathos of the scene.`

    images: ["/images/collections/peter_paul_rubens/two_satyrs.jpg"],
    description: `Peter Paul Rubens' painting Two Satyrs is an impressive work that showcases his ability to capture beauty and intensity in the human figure. This Flemish Baroque masterpiece is one of the artist's most remarkable, and its original size of 76 x 66 cm allows one to appreciate the detail and intricacy of the composition.

In the painting, Rubens represents two satyrs, a mythological figure that represents lust and passion. The satyrs are depicted in a dynamic pose, with one of them leaning on a tree and the other on a rock. The anatomical details of the bodies are impressive, with perfectly delineated muscles and veins.

The composition of the painting is very interesting, as Rubens has managed to create a sense of movement and tension in the scene. Satyrs seem to be in the middle of a conversation or discussion, and their gestures and facial expressions are very expressive. The use of the diagonal in the composition also adds dynamism to the scene.

Color is another prominent aspect of the painting. Rubens uses a palette of warm and vibrant colors that reinforce the feeling of passion and desire that emerges from the work. The red and gold tones are especially intense, and they contrast with the greens and blues of the nature that surrounds them.

The story behind the painting is also very interesting. Two Satyrs was painted in 1618, during the period when Rubens worked for the Spanish court in Madrid. The work was commissioned by the Duke of Lerma, who was the prime minister of King Felipe III. The painting was acquired by the Museo del Prado in Madrid in 1834, and has been one of the most admired works in the collection ever since.`

    description: `In a legend, Saint George—a soldier venerated in Christianity—defeats a dragon. The story goes that the dragon originally extorted tribute from villagers. When they ran out of livestock and trinkets for the dragon, they started giving up a human tribute once a year. This was acceptable to the villagers until a princess was chosen as the next offering. The saint thereupon rescues the princess and kills the dragon. The narrative was first set in Cappadocia in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to Libya in the 13th-century Golden Legend.

The narrative has pre-Christian origins (Jason and Medea, Perseus and Andromeda, Typhon, etc.),[1] and is recorded in various saints' lives prior to its attribution to St. George specifically. It was particularly attributed to Saint Theodore Tiro in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century. The oldest known record of Saint George slaying a dragon is found in a Georgian text of the 11th century.

The legend and iconography spread rapidly through the Byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century. It reached Western Christian tradition still in the 12th century, via the crusades. The knights of the First Crusade believed that St. George, along with his fellow soldier-saints Demetrius, Maurice, Theodore and Mercurius had fought alongside them at Antioch and Jerusalem. The legend was popularised in Western tradition in the 13th century based on its Latin versions in the Speculum Historiale and the Golden Legend. At first limited to the courtly setting of Chivalric romance, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, and it has become an integral part of the Christian traditions relating to Saint George in both Eastern and Western tradition.`

    description: `After Sebastian had survived execution by bowmen and protested publicly against the persecution of the Christians, the Roman Emperor had him slain. The miraculous deliverance of the saint, transfixed by arrows, was regarded even in early times as a parallel to the resurrection of Christ. The figure of the martyr as portrayed by Rubens is also intended to recall the Crucifixion. Bound to a tree, his eyes turned upwards to heaven, he seems only slightly affected by the bleeding wounds. The way in which the bound man twists his body may be taken as a sign of pain but this does not lessen its beauty, which is that of a hero of antiquity.

In his Sebastian picture, which must have been painted c. 1614, Rubens realized many of the impressions he had gained during his eight years in Italy (1600 - 08). The sculptural, corporeal quality of the saint's figure reminds one both of the antique and of Michelangelo's works. The contrasting light and shade and the realistic treatment of detail were touches that Rubens had learned from Caravaggio. But in combining the statuesque figure with the atmosphere of an evening landscape, the Flemish painter surpassed his Roman master. Here the tragedy of the event finds adequate expression in the language of nature.

In a letter of 1618 to Sir Dudley Carlton, Rubens mentions a selection of his own paintings, which he had kept back in his house 'for his own pleasure' and which he was prepared to exchange for works of art in the possession of the English diplomat. Among the pictures included in the painter's offer is a 'naked Saint Sebastian by my hand', in all probability the one now in Berlin.`

The symbolism of the double-portrait alludes to meanings of love and marriage, such as the holding of right hands (dextrarum iunctio), and the concept of the garden of love. The pose of the two figures and their fine clothing signify self-fashioning by Rubens. They wed in 1609, the same year that work was created; it was ultimately given to Isabella’s father Jan Brant and would later end up in the collection of Johann Wilhem II of Düsseldorf. The couple would be married for seventeen years, and have three children before Isabella died in 1625. Her death would have a profound impact on Rubens and through his loss he created an posthumous portrait.`
